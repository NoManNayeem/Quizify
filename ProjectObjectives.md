# Quizify Project Objectives

## Overview
Quizify is a quiz-playing application with a backend developed using Actix Web and a frontend with ReactJS. It is designed to provide an engaging platform for users to participate in quizzes, with role-based access control (RBAC) to manage different types of users.

---

## User Roles
1. **Admin**: Responsible for managing the platform, including creating quizzes, managing players, and monitoring activity.
2. **Player**: End-users who participate in the quizzes and view their results.

## Minimal Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
- Secure user authentication using email and password.
- Token-based authentication (JWT) for session management.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict actions based on user roles.

### 2. **Admin Features**
- **Quiz Management**:
  - Create, update, and delete quizzes.
  - Add, edit, or remove questions within quizzes.
  - Define quiz attributes such as time limits, difficulty levels, and scoring criteria.
- **User Management**:
  - View and manage player accounts.
  - Assign roles to users (e.g., promote a player to admin).
- **Analytics**:
  - View quiz participation and performance statistics.

### 3. **Player Features**
- **Quiz Participation**:
  - Browse available quizzes by category or difficulty.
  - Start and submit quizzes within the defined time limit.
- **Results**:
  - View detailed results for completed quizzes, including correct answers and scores.
  - Access historical performance data (quiz history).

### 4. **Quiz Functionality**
- Multiple question types: Multiple-choice, true/false, and short answer.
- Randomization of questions and answer options.
- Timer for timed quizzes.

### 5. **APIs**
- **Admin APIs**:
  - CRUD operations for quizzes and questions.
  - User management endpoints.
- **Player APIs**:
  - Fetch available quizzes.
  - Submit quiz answers and retrieve results.
- **Shared APIs**:
  - User authentication and registration.
  - Fetch user profile information.

### 6. **Additional Features**
- **Error Handling**:
  - Comprehensive error messages and status codes for all API endpoints.
- **Validation**:
  - Input validation for user registration, quiz creation, and answers submission.
- **Security**:
  - Secure password storage using hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
  - Rate limiting and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

---

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Actix Web (Rust)
- **Frontend**: ReactJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for minimal implementation)
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Hosting**: Dockerized application, deployable to cloud platforms like AWS or Heroku.

---

## Goals
1. Build a robust backend with scalable APIs to support quiz management and participation.
2. Ensure secure and efficient role-based access control (RBAC).
3. Provide a minimal but functional platform to facilitate quiz creation and participation.

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time leaderboards and scoring.
- Social sharing of quiz results.
- Support for team-based quizzes.
- Integration with third-party services for analytics and notifications.
